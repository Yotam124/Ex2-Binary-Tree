# Ex2-Binary-Tree

The program is written in C++ code and deals with a tree class that represents a binary tree.

In the program there are functions that actuate various operations on a binary tree such as insert, and remove.

There are several files in the program:

    TreeDemo - A file that simulates "main".
    
    TreeTest - A department that checks the integrity of all the functions in the program.
    
    Tree.hpp - containing node struct, and the tree class with only the functions Signatures:
    
             * constructor
             * insert
             * remove
             * size
             * contains
             * root
             * parent
             * left
             * right
             * print
    
    Tree.cpp - this is the implementation of Tree.hpp functions and include Auxiliary functions.
